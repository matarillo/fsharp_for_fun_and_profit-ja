I've been thinking for a while that F# needs a "birthday" that we can celebrate as a community.

Of course, like any long term project, there is rarely a single date that you can point to as a birthday. 
Even the [4th of July](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/why-july-2-is-really-americas-independence-day/2012/07/02/gJQABsMHIW_blog.html)
and [the Queen's birthday](http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueensbirthdays.aspx) are not as straightforward as they seem.

Nevertheless, it's fun to celebrate a date, even if it's not accurate!

So what date would best symbolize the "birth" of F#?  As far as I can tell, there was no "big bang" for the early releases of F#, including F# 1.0.

But five years ago, on April 12, F# 2.0 was released fully integrated with Visual Studio 2010.
And for the first time, a high quality statically-typed functional programming language became widely distributed to mainstream programmers. 
Here's [Don's post for that day.](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/04/12/f-2-0-released-as-part-of-visual-studio-2010.aspx)

So I'd like to celebrate that five year anniversary today, and honor the huge amount of work that went into that launch.

Furthermore, I propose that we call April 12th "F# day" from now on and celebrate each it each year with huge fireworks and lots of beer.
(Ok, maybe we don't *have* to have fireworks, but the beer is essential).

Happy F# Day!

As should be apparent, you should generally try to prefer functional-style code over object-oriented code in F#, but in some situations, you may need all the features of a fully fledged OO language ? classes, inheritance, virtual methods, etc.  

So just to conclude this section, here is a whirlwind tour of the F# versions of these features.  

Some of these will be dealt with in much more depth in a later series on .NET integration. But I won't cover some of the more obscure ones, as you can read about them in the MSDN documentation if you ever need them.

## Classes and interfaces ##

First, here are some examples of an interface, an abstract class, and a concrete class that inherits from the abstract class.

```fsharp
// interface
type IEnumerator<'a> = 
    abstract member Current : 'a
    abstract MoveNext : unit -> bool 

// abstract base class with virtual methods
[<AbstractClass>]
type Shape() = 
    //readonly properties
    abstract member Width : int with get
    abstract member Height : int with get
    //non-virtual method
    member this.BoundingArea = this.Height * this.Width
    //virtual method with base implementation
    abstract member Print : unit -> unit 
    default this.Print () = printfn "I'm a shape"

// concrete class that inherits from base class and overrides 
type Rectangle(x:int, y:int) = 
    inherit Shape()
    override this.Width = x
    override this.Height = y
    override this.Print ()  = printfn "I'm a Rectangle"

//test
let r = Rectangle(2,3)
printfn "The width is %i" r.Width
printfn "The area is %i" r.BoundingArea
r.Print()
```

Classes can have multiple constructors, mutable properties, and so on.

```fsharp
type Circle(rad:int) = 
    inherit Shape()

    //mutable field
    let mutable radius = rad
    
    //property overrides
    override this.Width = radius * 2
    override this.Height = radius * 2
    
    //alternate constructor with default radius
    new() = Circle(10)      

    //property with get and set
    member this.Radius
         with get() = radius
         and set(value) = radius <- value

// test constructors
let c1 = Circle()   // parameterless ctor
printfn "The width is %i" c1.Width
let c2 = Circle(2)  // main ctor
printfn "The width is %i" c2.Width

// test mutable property
c2.Radius <- 3
printfn "The width is %i" c2.Width
```

## Generics ##

F# supports generics and all the associated constraints.

```fsharp
// standard generics
type KeyValuePair<'a,'b>(key:'a, value: 'b) = 
    member this.Key = key
    member this.Value = value
    
// generics with constraints
type Container<'a,'b 
    when 'a : equality 
    and 'b :> System.Collections.ICollection>
    (name:'a, values:'b) = 
    member this.Name = name
    member this.Values = values
```

## Structs ##

F# supports not just classes, but the .NET struct types as well, which can help to boost performance in certain cases.

```fsharp

type Point2D =
   struct
      val X: float
      val Y: float
      new(x: float, y: float) = { X = x; Y = y }
   end

//test
let p = Point2D()  // zero initialized
let p2 = Point2D(2.0,3.0)  // explicitly initialized
```

## Exceptions ##

F# can create exception classes, raise them and catch them.

```fsharp
// create a new Exception class
exception MyError of string

try
    let e = MyError("Oops!")
    raise e
with 
    | MyError msg -> 
        printfn "The exception error was %s" msg
    | _ -> 
        printfn "Some other exception" 
```

## Extension methods ##

Just as in C#, F# can extend existing classes with extension methods.

```fsharp
type System.String with
    member this.StartsWithA = this.StartsWith "A"

//test
let s = "Alice"
printfn "'%s' starts with an 'A' = %A" s s.StartsWithA

type System.Int32 with
    member this.IsEven = this % 2 = 0

//test
let i = 20
if i.IsEven then printfn "'%i' is even" i
```

## Parameter arrays ##

Just like C#'s variable length "params" keyword, this allows a variable length list of arguments to be converted to a single array parameter.

```fsharp
open System
type MyConsole() =
    member this.WriteLine([<ParamArray>] args: Object[]) =
        for arg in args do
            printfn "%A" arg

let cons = new MyConsole()
cons.WriteLine("abc", 42, 3.14, true)
```

## Events ##

F# classes can have events, and the events can be triggered and responded to.

```fsharp
type MyButton() =
    let clickEvent = new Event<_>()

    [<CLIEvent>]
    member this.OnClick = clickEvent.Publish

    member this.TestEvent(arg) =
        clickEvent.Trigger(this, arg)

// test
let myButton = new MyButton()
myButton.OnClick.Add(fun (sender, arg) -> 
        printfn "Click event with arg=%O" arg)

myButton.TestEvent("Hello World!")
```

## Delegates ##

F# can do delegates.

```fsharp
// delegates
type MyDelegate = delegate of int -> int
let f = MyDelegate (fun x -> x * x)
let result = f.Invoke(5)
```

## Enums ##

F# supports CLI enums types, which look similar to the "union" types, but are actually different behind the scenes.

```fsharp
// enums
type Color = | Red=1 | Green=2 | Blue=3

let color1  = Color.Red    // simple assignment
let color2:Color = enum 2  // cast from int
// created from parsing a string
let color3 = System.Enum.Parse(typeof<Color>,"Green") :?> Color // :?> is a downcast

[<System.FlagsAttribute>]
type FileAccess = | Read=1 | Write=2 | Execute=4 
let fileaccess = FileAccess.Read ||| FileAccess.Write
```

## Working with the standard user interface ##

Finally, F# can work with the WinForms and WPF user interface libraries, just like C#.  

Here is a trivial example of opening a form and handling a click event.

```fsharp
open System.Windows.Forms 

let form = new Form(Width= 400, Height = 300, Visible = true, Text = "Hello World") 
form.TopMost <- true
form.Click.Add (fun args-> printfn "the form was clicked")
form.Show()
```

In this post, we'll implement a simple stack based calculator (also known as "reverse Polish" style). The implementation is almost entirely done with functions, with only one special type and no pattern matching at all, so it is a great testing ground for the concepts introduced in this series.

If you are not familiar with a stack based calculator, it works as follows: numbers are pushed on a stack, and operations such as addition and multiplication pop numbers off the stack and push the result back on.

Here is a diagram showing a simple calculation using a stack:

![Stack based calculator diagram](../assets/img/stack-based-calculator.png) 

The first steps to designing a system like this is to think about how it would be used. Following a Forth like syntax, we will give each action a label, so that the example above might want to be written something like:

    EMPTY ONE THREE ADD TWO MUL SHOW

We might not be able to get this exact syntax, but let's see how close we can get.

## The Stack data type

First we need to define the data structure for a stack. To keep things simple, we'll just use a list of floats.

```fsharp
type Stack = float list
```

But, hold on, let's wrap it in a [single case union type](../posts/discriminated-unions.md#single-case) to make it more descriptive, like this:

```fsharp
type Stack = StackContents of float list
```

For more details on why this is nicer, read the discussion of single case union types in [this post](../posts/discriminated-unions.md#single-case).

Now, to create a new stack, we use `StackContents` as a constructor:

```fsharp
let newStack = StackContents [1.0;2.0;3.0]
```

And to extract the contents of an existing Stack,  we pattern match with `StackContents`:

```fsharp
let (StackContents contents) = newStack 

// "contents" value set to 
// float list = [1.0; 2.0; 3.0]
```


## The Push function

Next we need a way to push numbers on to the stack. This will be simply be prepending the new value at the front of the list using the "`::`" operator.  

Here is our push function:

```fsharp
let push x aStack =   
    let (StackContents contents) = aStack
    let newContents = x::contents
    StackContents newContents 
```

This basic function has a number of things worth discussing.

First, note that the list structure is immutable, so the function must accept an existing stack and return a new stack.  It cannot just alter the existing stack. In fact, all of the functions in this example will have a similar format like this:

    Input: a Stack plus other parameters
    Output: a new Stack

Next, what should the order of the parameters be? Should the stack parameter come first or last? If you remember the discussion of [designing functions for partial application](../posts/partial-application), you will remember that the most changeable thing should come last. You'll see shortly that this guideline will be born out.

Finally, the function can be made more concise by using pattern matching in the function parameter itself, rather than using a `let` in the body of the function.

Here is the rewritten version:

```fsharp
let push x (StackContents contents) =   
    StackContents (x::contents)
```

Much nicer!

And by the way, look at the nice signature it has:

```fsharp
val push : float -> Stack -> Stack
```

As we know from a [previous post](../posts/function-signatures), the signature tells you a lot about the function.
In this case, I could probably guess what it did from the signature alone, even without knowing that the name of the function was "push".
This is one of the reasons why it is a good idea to have explicit type names. If the stack type had just been a list of floats, it wouldn't have been as self-documenting.

Anyway, now let's test it:

```fsharp
let emptyStack = StackContents []
let stackWith1 = push 1.0 emptyStack 
let stackWith2 = push 2.0 stackWith1
```

Works great!

## Building on top of "push"

With this simple function in place, we can easily define an operation that pushes a particular number onto the stack. 

```fsharp
let ONE stack = push 1.0 stack
let TWO stack = push 2.0 stack
```

But wait a minute! Can you see that the `stack` parameter is used on both sides? In fact, we don't need to mention it at all. Instead we can skip the `stack` parameter and write the functions using partial application as follows:

```fsharp
let ONE = push 1.0
let TWO = push 2.0
let THREE = push 3.0
let FOUR = push 4.0
let FIVE = push 5.0
```

Now you can see that if the parameters for `push` were in a different order, we wouldn't have been able to do this. 

While we're at it, let's define a function that creates an empty stack as well:

```fsharp
let EMPTY = StackContents []
```

Let's test all of these now:

```fsharp
let stackWith1 = ONE EMPTY 
let stackWith2 = TWO stackWith1
let stackWith3  = THREE stackWith2 
```

These intermediate stacks are annoying ? can we get rid of them? Yes!  Note that these functions ONE, TWO, THREE all have the same signature:

```fsharp
Stack -> Stack
```

This means that they can be chained together nicely! The output of one can be fed into the input of the next, as shown below:

```fsharp
let result123 = EMPTY |> ONE |> TWO |> THREE 
let result312 = EMPTY |> THREE |> ONE |> TWO
```


## Popping the stack

That takes care of pushing onto the stack ? what about a `pop` function next?

When we pop the stack, we will return the top of the stack, obviously, but is that all?  

In an object-oriented style, [the answer is yes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.stack.pop.aspx). In an OO approach, we would *mutate* the stack itself behind the scenes, so that the top element was removed.

But in a functional style, the stack is immutable.  The only way to remove the top element is to create a *new stack* with the element removed.
In order for the caller to have access to this new diminished stack, it needs to be returned along with the top element itself.

In other words, the `pop` function will have to return *two* values, the top plus the new stack.  The easiest way to do this in F# is just to use a tuple.

Here's the implementation:

```fsharp
/// Pop a value from the stack and return it 
/// and the new stack as a tuple
let pop (StackContents contents) = 
    match contents with 
    | top::rest -> 
        let newStack = StackContents rest
        (top,newStack)
```

This function is also very straightforward. 

As before, we are extracting the `contents` directly in the parameter.

We then use a `match..with` expression to test the contents.

Next, we separate the top element from the rest, create a new stack from the remaining elements and finally return the pair as a tuple.

Try the code above and see what happens. You will get a compiler error!
The compiler has caught a case we have overlooked -- what happens if the stack is empty?

So now we have to decide how to handle this. 

* Option 1: Return a special "Success" or "Error" state, as we did in a [post from the "F# を使う理由" series](../posts/correctness-exhaustive-pattern-matching.md).
* Option 2: Throw an exception.

Generally, I prefer to use error cases, but in this case, we'll use an exception. So here's the `pop` code changed to handle the empty case:

```fsharp
/// Pop a value from the stack and return it 
/// and the new stack as a tuple
let pop (StackContents contents) = 
    match contents with 
    | top::rest -> 
        let newStack = StackContents rest
        (top,newStack)
    | [] -> 
        failwith "Stack underflow"
```

Now let's test it:

```fsharp
let initialStack = EMPTY  |> ONE |> TWO 
let popped1, poppedStack = pop initialStack
let popped2, poppedStack2 = pop poppedStack
```

and to test the underflow:

```fsharp
let _ = pop EMPTY
```

## Writing the math functions

Now with both push and pop in place, we can work on the "add" and "multiply" functions:

```fsharp
let ADD stack =
   let x,s = pop stack  //pop the top of the stack
   let y,s2 = pop s     //pop the result stack
   let result = x + y   //do the math
   push result s2       //push back on the doubly-popped stack

let MUL stack = 
   let x,s = pop stack  //pop the top of the stack
   let y,s2 = pop s     //pop the result stack
   let result = x * y   //do the math 
   push result s2       //push back on the doubly-popped stack
```

Test these interactively:

```fsharp
let add1and2 = EMPTY |> ONE |> TWO |> ADD
let add2and3 = EMPTY |> TWO |> THREE |> ADD
let mult2and3 = EMPTY |> TWO |> THREE |> MUL
```

It works!

### Time to refactor...

It is obvious that there is significant duplicate code between these two functions. How can we refactor?

Both functions pop two values from the stack, apply some sort of binary function, and then push the result back on the stack.  This leads us to refactor out the common code into a "binary" function that takes a two parameter math function as a parameter:

```fsharp
let binary mathFn stack = 
    // pop the top of the stack
    let y,stack' = pop stack    
    // pop the top of the stack again
    let x,stack'' = pop stack'  
    // do the math
    let z = mathFn x y
    // push the result value back on the doubly-popped stack
    push z stack''      
```

*Note that in this implementation, I've switched to using ticks to represent changed states of the "same" object, rather than numeric suffixes. Numeric suffixes can easily get quite confusing.*

Question: why are the parameters in the order they are, instead of `mathFn` being after `stack`?

Now that we have `binary`, we can define ADD and friends more simply:

Here's a first attempt at ADD using the new `binary` helper:

```fsharp
let ADD aStack = binary (fun x y -> x + y) aStack 
```

But we can eliminate the lambda, as it is *exactly* the definition of the built-in `+` function!  Which gives us:

```fsharp
let ADD aStack = binary (+) aStack 
```

And again, we can use partial application to hide the stack parameter. Here's the final definition:

```fsharp
let ADD = binary (+)
```

And here's the definition of some other math functions:

```fsharp
let SUB = binary (-)
let MUL = binary (*)
let DIV = binary (../)
```

Let's test interactively again.

```fsharp
let div2by3 = EMPTY |> THREE|> TWO |> DIV
let sub2from5 = EMPTY  |> TWO |> FIVE |> SUB
let add1and2thenSub3 = EMPTY |> ONE |> TWO |> ADD |> THREE |> SUB
```

In a similar fashion, we can create a helper function for unary functions

```fsharp
let unary f stack = 
    let x,stack' = pop stack  //pop the top of the stack
    push (f x) stack'         //push the function value on the stack
```
    
And then define some unary functions:

```fsharp
let NEG = unary (fun x -> -x)
let SQUARE = unary (fun x -> x * x)
```

Test interactively again:

```fsharp
let neg3 = EMPTY  |> THREE|> NEG
let square2 = EMPTY  |> TWO |> SQUARE
```

## Putting it all together

In the original requirements, we mentioned that we wanted to be able to show the results, so let's define a SHOW function.

```fsharp
let SHOW stack = 
    let x,_ = pop stack
    printfn "The answer is %f" x
    stack  // keep going with same stack
```

Note that in this case, we pop the original stack but ignore the diminished version. The final result of the function is the original stack, as if it had never been popped.

So now finally, we can write the code example from the original requirements

```fsharp
EMPTY |> ONE |> THREE |> ADD |> TWO |> MUL |> SHOW
```

### Going further

This is fun -- what else can we do?

Well, we can define a few more core helper functions:

```fsharp
/// Duplicate the top value on the stack
let DUP stack = 
    // get the top of the stack
    let x,_ = pop stack  
    // push it onto the stack again
    push x stack 
    
/// Swap the top two values
let SWAP stack = 
    let x,s = pop stack  
    let y,s' = pop s
    push y (push x s')   
    
/// Make an obvious starting point
let START  = EMPTY
```
    
And with these additional functions in place, we can write some nice examples:

```fsharp
START
    |> ONE |> TWO |> SHOW

START
    |> ONE |> TWO |> ADD |> SHOW 
    |> THREE |> ADD |> SHOW 

START
    |> THREE |> DUP |> DUP |> MUL |> MUL // 27

START
    |> ONE |> TWO |> ADD |> SHOW  // 3
    |> THREE |> MUL |> SHOW       // 9
    |> TWO |> SWAP |> DIV |> SHOW // 9 div 2 = 4.5
```

## Using composition instead of piping

But that's not all. In fact, there is another very interesting way to think about these functions. 

As I pointed out earlier, they all have an identical signature: 

```fsharp
Stack -> Stack
```

So, because the input and output types are the same, these functions can be composed using the composition operator `>>`, not just chained together with pipes. 

Here are some examples:

```fsharp
// define a new function
let ONE_TWO_ADD = 
    ONE >> TWO >> ADD 

// test it
START |> ONE_TWO_ADD |> SHOW

// define a new function
let SQUARE = 
    DUP >> MUL 

// test it
START |> TWO |> SQUARE |> SHOW

// define a new function
let CUBE = 
    DUP >> DUP >> MUL >> MUL 

// test it
START |> THREE |> CUBE |> SHOW

// define a new function
let SUM_NUMBERS_UPTO = 
    DUP                     // n  
    >> ONE >> ADD           // n+1
    >> MUL                  // n(n+1)
    >> TWO >> SWAP >> DIV   // n(n+1) / 2 

// test it
START |> THREE |> SQUARE |> SUM_NUMBERS_UPTO |> SHOW
```

In each of these cases, a new function is defined by composing other functions together to make a new one. This is a good example of the "combinator" approach to building up functionality.

## Pipes vs composition

We have now seen two different ways that this stack based model can be used; by piping or by composition. So what is the difference? And why would we prefer one way over another?

The difference is that piping is, in a sense, a "realtime transformation" operation. When you use piping you are actually doing the operations right now, passing a particular stack around.

On the other hand, composition is a kind of "plan" for what you want to do, building an overall function from a set of parts, but *not* actually running it yet.

So for example, I can create a "plan" for how to square a number by combining smaller operations:

```fsharp
let COMPOSED_SQUARE = DUP >> MUL 
```

I cannot do the equivalent with the piping approach.

```fsharp
let PIPED_SQUARE = DUP |> MUL 
```

This causes a compilation error. I have to have some sort of concrete stack instance to make it work:

```fsharp
let stackWith2 = EMPTY |> TWO
let twoSquared = stackWith2 |> DUP |> MUL 
```

And even then, I only get the answer for this particular input, not a plan for all possible inputs, as in the COMPOSED_SQUARE example.

The other way to create a "plan" is to explicitly pass in a lambda to a more primitive function, as we saw near the beginning:

```fsharp
let LAMBDA_SQUARE = unary (fun x -> x * x)
```

This is much more explicit (and is likely to be faster) but loses all the benefits and clarity of the composition approach.

So, in general, go for the composition approach if you can!

## Summary

So there we have it, a simple stack based calculator. We've seen how we can start with a few primitive operations (`push`, `pop`, `binary`, `unary`) and from them, build up a whole domain specific language that is both easy to implement and easy to use.

As you might guess, this example is based heavily on the Forth language. I highly recommend the free book ["Thinking Forth"](http://thinking-forth.sourceforge.net/), which is not just about the Forth language, but about (*non* object-oriented!) problem decomposition techniques which are equally applicable to functional programming.

I got the idea for this post from a great blog by [Ashley Feniello](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ashleyf/archive/2011/04/21/programming-is-pointless.aspx). If you want to go deeper into emulating a stack based language in F#, start there. Have fun!

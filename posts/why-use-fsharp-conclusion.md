This completes the tour of F# features. I hope that the examples have given you some appreciation of the power of F# and functional programming. If you have any comments on the series as a whole, please leave them at the bottom of this page.

In later series I hope to go deeper into data structures, pattern matching, list processing, asynchronous and parallel programming, and much more.

But before those, I recommend you read the ["thinking functionally"](../series/thinking-functionally.md) series, which will help you understand functional programming at a deeper level.

One nice thing about F# is that most types immediately have some useful "out-of-the-box" behavior such as immutability and built-in equality, functionality that often has to be explicitly coded for in C#.  

By "most" F# types, I mean the core "structural" types such as tuples, records, unions, options, lists, etc. Classes and some other types have been added to help with .NET integration, but lose some of the power of the structural types. 

This built-in functionality for these core types includes:

* Immutability
* Pretty printing when debugging
* Equality
* Comparisons

Each of these is addressed below.

## F# types have built-in immutability

In C# and Java, it is has become good practice to create immutable classes whenever possible. In F#, you get this for free.

Here is an immutable type in F#:
```fsharp
type PersonalName = {FirstName:string; LastName:string}
```

And here is how the same type is typically coded in C#:

```csharp
class ImmutablePersonalName
{
    public ImmutablePersonalName(string firstName, string lastName)
    {
        this.FirstName = firstName;
        this.LastName = lastName;
    }

    public string FirstName { get; private set; }
    public string LastName { get; private set; }
}
```

That's 10 lines to do the same thing as 1 line of F#.

## Most F# types have built-in pretty printing

In F#, you don't have to override `ToString()` for most types -- you get pretty printing for free!

You have probably already seen this when running the earlier examples. Here is another simple example:

```fsharp
type USAddress = 
   {Street:string; City:string; State:string; Zip:string}
type UKAddress = 
   {Street:string; Town:string; PostCode:string}
type Address = US of USAddress | UK of UKAddress
type Person = 
   {Name:string; Address:Address}

let alice = {
   Name="Alice"; 
   Address=US {Street="123 Main";City="LA";State="CA";Zip="91201"}}
let bob = {
   Name="Bob"; 
   Address=UK {Street="221b Baker St";Town="London";PostCode="NW1 6XE"}} 

printfn "Alice is %A" alice
printfn "Bob is %A" bob
```

The output is:

```fsharp
Alice is {Name = "Alice";
 Address = US {Street = "123 Main";
               City = "LA";
               State = "CA";
               Zip = "91201";};}
```

## Most F# types have built-in structural equality

In C#, you often have to implement the `IEquatable` interface so that you can test for equality between objects. This is needed when using objects for Dictionary keys, for example.

In F#, you get this for free with most F# types. For example, using the `PersonalName` type from above, we can compare two names straight away.

```fsharp
type PersonalName = {FirstName:string; LastName:string}
let alice1 = {FirstName="Alice"; LastName="Adams"}
let alice2 = {FirstName="Alice"; LastName="Adams"}
let bob1 = {FirstName="Bob"; LastName="Bishop"}

//test
printfn "alice1=alice2 is %A" (alice1=alice2)
printfn "alice1=bob1 is %A" (alice1=bob1)
```


## Most F# types are automatically comparable

In C#, you often have to implement the `IComparable` interface so that you can sort objects. 

Again, in F#, you get this for free with most F# types. For example, here is a simple definition of a deck of cards.

```fsharp

type Suit = Club | Diamond | Spade | Heart
type Rank = Two | Three | Four | Five | Six | Seven | Eight 
            | Nine | Ten | Jack | Queen | King | Ace
```

			
We can write a function to test the comparison logic:

```fsharp
let compareCard card1 card2 = 
    if card1 < card2 
    then printfn "%A is greater than %A" card2 card1 
    else printfn "%A is greater than %A" card1 card2 
```

And let's see how it works:

```fsharp
let aceHearts = Heart, Ace
let twoHearts = Heart, Two
let aceSpades = Spade, Ace

compareCard aceHearts twoHearts 
compareCard twoHearts aceSpades
```

Note that the Ace of Hearts is automatically greater than the Two of Hearts, because the "Ace" rank value comes after the "Two" rank value.

But also note that the Two of Hearts is automatically greater than the Ace of Spades, because the Suit part is compared first, and the "Heart" suit value comes after the "Spade" value.

Here's an example of a hand of cards:

```fsharp
let hand = [ Club,Ace; Heart,Three; Heart,Ace; 
             Spade,Jack; Diamond,Two; Diamond,Ace ]

//instant sorting!
List.sort hand |> printfn "sorted hand is (low to high) %A"
```

And as a side benefit, you get min and max for free too!

```fsharp
List.max hand |> printfn "high card is %A"
List.min hand |> printfn "low card is %A"
```
